		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
      If you are flummoxed with HTML5 video -- browers, codecs, and containers (Oh My!) -- this is your talk. In a plain-spoken, easy to understand style, Scott Davis will help you cut through
      the hype and the hope and add video to your website.
		</p>

		<p>
No HTML5 feature has generated as much excitement and controversy as the new native video element. In this talk, we'll cut through the hype and the skepticism and get to the real details. Which browsers support the video element? (Here's a hint: all of 'em...) Which codecs and containers should I use -- h.264  and MP4? Flash? Ogg Theora? WebM? And how is HTTP Live Streaming -- an Apple specification that is now going through the IETF standardization process -- dramatically changing the landscape of web video?
		</p>
		
		<p>
If you visit websites like YouTube or Netflix, you might already be using HTML5 to watch video. If you have a pile of DVDs waiting to be digitized and streamed in your house, you could be serving up your own DIY version of these websites. Come learn what's going on under the covers with HTML5 video and see how easy it is for you to get started.
